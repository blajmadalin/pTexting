Project info gathering:

a text messanger on a localyl run server where different people can connect (terminals) and 
send texts to eachother.

https - why?

std::thread - for multiple threads to run at once (multiple users);

bsd sockets?? (does it exist);

Two sides: client side, server side

client side:
 -connect to server
 -send messages
 -receive messages from server

server side:
  -send messages to clients

  do server side: 
    should listen on port (to check for connections right)
    create run server
    make connections available;
